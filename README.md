# ML Visuals

ML Visuals is a new collaborative effort to help the machine learning community in improving science communication through using more professional, compelling and adequate visuals and figures. You can use the visuals in your presentations or blog posts.

This is a project made by the dair.ai community and maintained in this GitHub repo. Our community members will continue to add more common figures and basic elements in upcoming versions. Think of this as free and open artefacts and templates which you can easily use, reuse and customize to your own needs.

To add your own custom figures, simply add a new slide and reuse any of the basic visual components. You can also create your own copy of the slides and customize whatever you like. We encourage others to add their visuals here and allow others to reuse them. Make sure to include your author information (in the notes section of the slide) so that others can properly attribute if they use the visuals elsewhere (e.g. blog). Also, provide a short description of your visual to help the user understand what it is about and how they can use it. If you need "Edit" permission, just click on the "request edit access" option under the "view only" toolbar above or send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com.


If you need help with customizing a figure, we can help you. Just open an issue [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/visuals/issues/new) and we will do our best to help you. Be very descriptive with your request. Thanks.
