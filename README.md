# ML Visuals

[ML Visuals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11mR1nkIR9fbHegFkcFq8z9oDQ5sjv8E3JJp1LfLGKuk/edit?usp=sharing) is a new collaborative effort to help the machine learning community in improving science communication by providing free professional, compelling and adequate visuals and figures. You are free to use the visuals in your presentations or blog posts. You don’t need to ask permission to use any of the visuals but it will be nice if you can provide credit to the designer/author (author information found in the slide notes). Check out the versions of the visuals below. 

This is a project made by the dair.ai community. The latest version of the Google slides can be found in this GitHub repository. Our community members will continue to add more common figures and basic elements in upcoming versions. Think of this as free and open artifacts and templates which you can freely and easily download, copy, distribute, reuse and customize to your own needs.

## How to Use?

Essentially, we are using Google Slides to maintain all visuals and figures (check the versions below). To add your own custom figures, simply add a new slide and reuse any of the basic visual components (remember to request edit permissions). You can also create your own copy of the slides and customize whatever you like. We encourage authors/designers to add their visuals here and allow others to reuse them. Make sure to include your author information (in the notes section of the slide) so that others can provide credit if they use the visuals elsewhere (e.g. blog/presentations). Also, provide a short description of your visual to help the user understand what it is about and how they can use it. If you need "Edit" permission, just click on the "request edit access" option under the "view only" toolbar (in Google Slides) or send me an email at ellfae@gmail.com.

Downloading a figure from any of the slides is easy. Just click on File→Download→(choose your format).

If you need help with customizing a figure or have an idea of something that could be valuable to others, we can help. Just open an issue [here](https://github.com/dair-ai/ml-visuals/issues/new) and we will do our best to come up with the visual. Thanks.
