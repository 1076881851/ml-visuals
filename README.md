# ML Visuals

Visuals is a new collaborative effort to help the AI community in improving science communication through using more professional, compelling and adequate visuals and figures.

This is a project made by the dair.ai community and maintained in this GitHub repo. Our community members will continue to add more figures in upcoming versions. Think of this as providing templates which you can easily customize to your own taste.

To add your own custom figures, simply add a new slide and reuse any of the basic visual components. You can also create your own copy of the slides and customize whatever you like. We encourage others to add their visuals here and allow others to reuse them. Make sure to include your author information (in the notes section of the slide) so that others can properly attribute if they use the visuals elsewhere (e.g. blog). Also, provide a short description of your visual to help the user understand what it is about and how they can use it.

If you need help with customizing a figure, we can help you. Just open an issue here and we will do our best to help you. Be very descriptive with your request. Thanks.
